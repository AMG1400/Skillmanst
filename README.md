Skillman St. is a creative and stylish fashion brand inspired by the vibrant culture of Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. This project is a static website built to showcase the brand's unique clothing designs, story, and community roots.

My Role:
I designed and developed this website as a portfolio project to demonstrate my skills in front end web development. The site features clean HTML and CSS with a focus on visual design and user experience.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- GitHub Pages (for hosting)

Features:
- Responsive layout optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- Clean, semantic HTML structure for easy navigation and accessibility
- Custom styling reflecting the brand's aesthetic and story
- Multiple sections highlighting the brandâ€™s background, products, and contact information

What I Learned:
- How to structure and style a modern, responsive website using HTML and CSS
- Best practices for organizing project files and using GitHub Pages for deployment
- The importance of branding and storytelling in web design

Future Improvements:
- Add JavaScript interactivity such as image sliders and form validation
- Improve mobile responsiveness with advanced media queries
- Integrate a backend using Java (e.g., REST API) to manage products or user messages
- Implement SEO best practices and accessibility enhancements
